Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection-Applied Machine Learning Analysis with Python,UT Dallas May. 2023
●Introduction: 
With the development of the fintech industry, credit cards are increasingly becoming a widely used payment method around the world. The main risks of credit cards include credit risk, operational risk and fraud risk. Among them, the fraud risk is highly concealed and difficult to trace, which causes greater risk of loss to banks and cardholders. And credit card fraud is an increasingly serious global problem, costing millions of dollars each year due to illegal activities such as identity theft. 
The purpose of the project is to discover a predictive model for fraud detection. By analyzing data sets, we can discover the characteristics and patterns of fraudulent transactions, so as to help identify and mark any suspicious transactions, and help banks and other financial institutions and organizations detect fraudulent transactions in a timely manner to prevent them , to reduce losses. 
●Data set： 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection 
The project will use dataset from Kaggle containing anonymized credit card transactions, which was generated using Sparkov Data Generation - GitHub tool created by Brandon Harris. The dataset contains  legitimate and  fraudulent  transactions from  Jan 2019 to  Dec 2020,covering credit cards  transactions  between of 1000 customers with 800 merchants. The dataset  contains both training and  testing tables with 23 columns respectively and  is labeled ,which will help training  models. 
●Methodology: 
The project employs machine learning algorithms such as supervising learning, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests and clustering to train the models. And the models are evaluated by its accuracy, scores and etc. 
●software:Python ,Anaconda, Jupiter notebook.


Analysis of Factors Affecting Crime in Texas -Time Series Analysis with STATA,UT Dallas Dec. 2022
●Data source: collected the crime rate for 2021 around 254 cities in Texas and some major factors such as age, graduation rate, income, race, etc,(2021 cross sectional data) ,also referred 
 the crime data in 1987 and 1982 .
●Literature Findings: referred some reports and papers, then found some relationships between the variables, such as income, inflation, divorce rate,etc
●Empirical Method: Using STATA. Created Instrumental variables, and conducted 2SLS regression(2015 div rate=2010 div rate) ,Simple Linear Regression , Multiple Linear Regression, time series analysis, AR(1) model(crime,crime_1),FDL model, static model(all cross section data), log model(right skewed), Models with Quadratics and Interaction ,trend, two-Period Panel Data Analysis(using the dataset-crime2,Fixed Effects Model: a positive, statistically significant relationship between the crime and unemployment rates​)
●Data visualization: scatter plot, line chart, etc.
●Using STATA,created Instrumental variables, and conducted 2SLS regression,,explored SLR , MLR, AR(1) model,FDL model, static model,, log model, Models with Quadratics and Interaction ,trend, two-Period Panel Data Analysis,Fixed Effects Model; 
●Analyzed the Texas crime rate with the most recent data describing the contributing factors and found that crime rate in the last year
can be good predictor for current year; increase amount of policeman and police office is good choice for reducing crime rate, etc. 
●Contribution: analyzed the crime rate based on the divorce rate and the number of churches; analysis of the Texas crime rate with the most recent data describing the contributing factors. 
●Conclusion: Generally speaking, crime rate has decreased recently. Significant Variables include age, race, drop out rate, number of Police; income is not significant ;crime rate in the last year can be good predictor for current year; increase amount of policeman and police office is good choice for reducing crime rate, etc.


Credit Card Approval Prediction and Transaction Fraud Risk Analysis with R , UT Dallas Nov.2022
●Data Source: sourced our data from Kaggle, Credit Card Approval Rating database
on Kaggle, link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction
Data process: Using R,deal with missing data and outlier, assign value to "X", "0", "1" in the table, calculated group mean, set up the risk threshold and rules, merge data, deal with data unbalance issue .etc.
●Data Visualization: line chart, bar chart, histogram, Side-by-Side Bar Chart, heatmap, correlation chart etc.
●Using R,python and Machine Learning methods ,dealt with missing data and outlier, set up the risk threshold and rules, dealt with
data unbalance issue ,created line chart, histogram, Side-by-Side Bar Chart, heat map, correlation chart and etc. ; 
●Explored regression model(AIC method),transformation model,classification tree model,decision tree,RandomForest,SVM,clustering
models and found women's preferences should be considered; Transaction content and time are highly related to fraud risk. 
●Data modeling, prediction and evaluation: linear regression model(Use AIC method to select model); log transformation model; classification tree model, accuracy( use RMSE ,function accuracy ,etc.)
●Data inference and conclusion:, women's preferences should be considered; Cooperating with manufacturers of maternal and child products and daily necessities to promote credit
cards may be a good choice ; Applicants who own real estate, have more work experience and better work and communication; status have a relatively lower risk of default; whether they own real estate or not has no significant impact on the status of presumed default status; balance profits and risks; segment and dynamic management●Data modeling, prediction and evaluation: linear regression model(Use AIC method to select model); log transformation model; classification tree model, accuracy( use RMSE ,function accuracy ,etc.)

Patient Information Database System ,UT Dallas Jul. 2022
●Used SQL, built tables, including more than 15 tables, 4 triggers, 2 procedures, 3 functions, mainly collected patient information, insurance information, medical data information;
●Managed to help patients make appointments with doctors and check schedule conveniently,help doctors better understand patient
information and built the connection between medical data and insurance company data , etc.
